        <h1>Hello, nice to meet you.</h1>

        <p>Thanks for using Diffux! If you happen to bump into a problem or
        think of a feature you'd like to see, %{link}.  And, if you are the
        coding type, we'd be delighted to accept your pull requests.</p>

        <p>There are plenty of keyboard shortcuts to help you use Diffux
        efficiently. Just press <kbd>?</kbd> to see all of the keyboard
        shortcuts.</p>

        <p>But first, you'll want to create a new project and give it some
        viewport widths and URLs to snapshot.</p>
